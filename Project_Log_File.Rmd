# Log File
## Week 1
Spent two hours revising and selecting my data set in Kaggle.
**Selected data set: "Airbnb Market Analysis & Real Estate Sales Data"**
Source[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/zillow-market-analysis-and-real-estate-sales-data]

## Week 2
Dataset experimentation and plotting
```R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

#Reading Airbnb Market_Analysis
data_first <- read.csv('/Users/nataliaramirez/Desktop/CSC324/market_analysis.csv', sep = ';')

# Filtering by airbnb's with 5 bedrooms, selecting only 
# important columns, mutating guests to display 
# only numbers, group the graph by guests
data_first <- data_first %>%
                filter(bedrooms == "5") %>%
                select(zipcode:nightly.rate) %>%
                mutate(guests = as.numeric(gsub("\\+", "", guests)),
                revenue = as.numeric(gsub(",", ".", revenue)),
                nightly.rate = as.numeric(gsub(",", ".", nightly.rate))) %>%
                filter(revenue != 0.00)

select(city, Attribute, Measurement) %>%
qplot(Attribute, Measurement,
        geom = "boxplot",
        facets = . ~ city, data = .)

# Filtering data and getting rid of rows with no nightly rate
data_select <- data_first %>%
  mutate(occupancy= as.numeric(gsub(",", ".", occupancy))) %>%
  select(city, bedrooms, bathrooms, guests, occupancy, nightly.rate, revenue) 
print(data_select)

# Summarizing based on mean for average nightly rate and max value in revenue
summary_data <- data_select %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_nightly_rate = mean(nightly.rate),
    max_revenue = max(revenue)
  )
print(summary_data)

select(city, Attribute, Measurement) %>%
    qplot(Attribute, Measurement,
        geom = "point",
        facets = . ~ city, data = .)

#Arranging in descending order based on the occupancy column
arranged_data <- data_select %>%
  arrange(desc(occupancy))

print(arranged_data)
