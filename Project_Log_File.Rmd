# Log File
## Week 1
Spent two hours revising and selecting my data set in Kaggle.
**Selected data set: "Airbnb Market Analysis & Real Estate Sales Data"**
Source[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/zillow-market-analysis-and-real-estate-sales-data]

## Week 2
Dataset experimentation and plotting
```R
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)

#Reading Airbnb Market_Analysis
data_first <- read.csv('/Users/nataliaramirez/Desktop/CSC324/market_analysis.csv', sep = ';')

# Filtering by airbnb's with 5 bedrooms, selecting only 
# important columns, mutating guests to display 
# only numbers, group the graph by guests
data_first <- data_first %>%
                filter(bedrooms == "5") %>%
                select(zipcode:nightly.rate) %>%
                mutate(guests = as.numeric(gsub("\\+", "", guests)),
                revenue = as.numeric(gsub(",", ".", revenue)),
                nightly.rate = as.numeric(gsub(",", ".", nightly.rate))) %>%
                filter(revenue != 0.00) 

#Plotting a boxplot
data_first |>
  as_tibble() |>
  select(city, revenue) |>
  head(3)
  
data_first %>%
  select(city, revenue) %>%
  qplot(city, revenue, geom = "boxplot", data = .)

data_first |>
  pivot_longer(
    c(revenue, nightly.rate),
    names_to = "Attribute",
    values_to = "Measurement"
) |>

select(city, Attribute, Measurement) %>%
qplot(Attribute, Measurement,
        geom = "boxplot",
        facets = . ~ city, data = .)

# Filtering data and getting rid of rows with no nightly rate
data_select <- data_first %>%
  mutate(occupancy= as.numeric(gsub(",", ".", occupancy))) %>%
  select(city, bedrooms, bathrooms, guests, occupancy, nightly.rate, revenue) 
print(data_select)

# Summarizing based on mean for average nightly rate and max value in revenue
summary_data <- data_select %>%
  group_by(city) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_nightly_rate = mean(nightly.rate),
    max_revenue = max(revenue)
  )
print(summary_data)

# Using tidyr to plot both measurements in a scatter plot
summary_data |>
  pivot_longer(
    c(avg_nightly_rate, max_revenue),
    names_to = "Attribute",
    values_to = "Measurement"
) |>

select(city, Attribute, Measurement) %>%
    qplot(Attribute, Measurement,
        geom = "point",
        facets = . ~ city, data = .)

#Arranging in descending order based on the occupancy column
arranged_data <- data_select %>%
  arrange(desc(occupancy))

print(arranged_data)
```
## Week 3
Experimentation with visualizations.
### Histogram
```R
# ggplot histogram
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = bathrooms)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "coral1", color = "black", bins = 7) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Number of Bathrooms (ggplot2)",
       x = "Number of Bathrooms", y = "Frequency")
```

## Week 4
### Bubbleplot
```R
# Aggregating the data for each bathroom number and getting the average nightly rate and revenue
summary_stats <- aggregate(cbind(revenue, nightly.rate) ~ bathrooms, data = data_filter, 
                            FUN = function(x) c(median = median(x), average = mean(x)))
                            
# Plotting the bubble graph with transparency and the Revenue vs Average Nightly Rate by Number of Bathrooms
ggplot(summary_stats, aes(x = `nightly.rate`[,"average"], y = `revenue`[,"median"], size = bathrooms)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Bubble Graph: Revenue vs Average Nightly Rate by Number of Bathrooms",
       x = "Average Nightly Rate",
       y = "Average Revenue",
       size = "Number of Bathrooms") +
  theme_minimal()
```
